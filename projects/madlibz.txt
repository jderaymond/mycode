A Scary Halloween Story
They say my school is haunted; my wer friend asdsays they saw a gr wet floating at the end of the hall near the cafeteria. Some say if you 45 down that hallway at night, you'll hear a 1f growling deeply. My adv friend wert saw a adgr6 adg23 slithering under the tables once. I hope I never see any gjfg crawling; eating lunch there is scary enough!
